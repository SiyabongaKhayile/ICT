                Every company needs an ICT specialist, who not only understands the technology behind computers and mobile devices but also understands the needs of the company and the workforce. So an ICT professional is in charge of the physical hardware like computers, printers, and copiers, as well as software, communication and connection systems, and online platforms. They also know how to use these technologies to streamline business processes. An ICT specialist designs, maintains, and services the systems used to generate, store, send and retrieve data. The ICT qualification from MUT has been specifically designed to prepare students directly for the workplace.

            <h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
            <p>
                There are a wide range of careers in this field, ranging from librarians to the military. You can become a computer service technician, a programmer, data technician, web developer, systems analyst or IT engineer. Most companies of any size will also employ an ICT specialist to maintain their hardware and software and offer technological support to staff, while there are jobs within companies that specialise in offering ICT services.

                            This qualification has been re-aligned to the new HEQSF and takes into account the latest ICT industry requirements. The qualification has also been formulated to reflect the latest workplace-based trends within the ICT industry, to ensure that qualifying learners will have accessibility to employment within the industry. The inclusion of a work-integrated learning component as part of a credit-bearing module at NQF-6 is a unique concept within the University of Technology ICT sector in SA. This, together with the project-based and problem-solving approach embedded in the qualification, will have the defined purpose of capacitating the student with workplace-applicable competencies.

                        <h3>Rationale for Qualification</h3>
                        <p>
                            This qualification has been re-aligned to the new HEQSF and takes into account the latest ICT industry requirements. The qualification has also been formulated to reflect the latest workplace-based trends within the ICT industry, to ensure that qualifying learners will have accessibility to employment within the industry.

                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The qualification was established through extensive research, international comparisons, and national discussions between representatives of the ICT industry and academic institutions. The qualification prepares students for entry-level positions in the ICT or related industries in either the software development or the communication networks sub-domains. Students are provided with a general all-round working knowledge of the ICT industry and are required to choose electives at second- and third-year levels to follow a specified career path. The skills shortage within the software development and the communication networks fields, particularly in KZN, led to MUT offering these two specialization streams. The objective of the qualification is to satisfy the industry needs, locally, regionally, and nationally for ICT with specific reference to the areas of Software Development and Communication Networks.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of the Diploma in Information Technology is to provide a career-focused professional qualification featuring industry-referenced knowledge, skills, and attitudes. A learner will be knowledgeable and competent in the discourse and practice of the Information Technology (IT) discipline, will have specialist knowledge of a particular sub-discipline of IT (depending on chosen electives), and will be subjected to a range of professional and personal development initiatives relevant to the IT industry.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Accordingly, the main purpose of the qualification may be stated as follow: a qualifying learner at this level is competent in the development of IT systems in a distributed computing environment, and depending on the chosen electives, will be competent in:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Software Development: Designing and producing software products and systems to meet specified needs so that they work reliably, and their production and maintenance is cost-effective.</li>
                            <li>Communications Networks: Designing, developing, implementing and managing networks by integrating knowledge of modern network topologies and protocols to create an appropriate and adequate environment of communication and information sharing.</li>
                        </ul>

                            As part of the department's access programme, the 3-year IT Diploma qualification is also offered as an Extended Curriculum Programme (ECP) which includes an additional year of study during which students are prepared for the diploma programme. This programme is offered to a limited number of prospective students who do not meet the cut-off criteria for entry into the diploma but demonstrate an aptitude for study in the ICT field. This section explains how the ECP is implemented.

                        <h3>Rationale for Qualification</h3>
                        <p>
                            In line with its mission of expanding access to IT qualifications, the Department also offers an extended curriculum programme (4-years minimum duration) intended for those students who are ranked just outside of the cut-off point for the mainstream programme. In their first year of study, students take introductory courses intended to prepare them for study towards the Diploma. After successfully completing all four introductory subjects, students proceed into the first year of the diploma programme. Students who do not pass all subjects may be allowed to take a limited number of diploma subjects in their second year of study, provided special permission is granted by the department and provided that the prerequisites indicated in the curriculum compilation table below are met. The rationale for the mainstream diploma programme has relevance to this qualification as years 2, 3, 4 of the access programme correspond to years 1, 2, 3 of the mainstream programme.

                        <h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
                        <p>
                            This programme is intended for students who meet the minimum entry criteria, but may not be sufficiently prepared for entry into the 3-year diploma programme. The primary objective of this programme is to expand access to IT qualifications to those students who have demonstrated the aptitude but have not been exposed to opportunities to further prepare them for study in the ICT field. After the first year of study in this programme, the purpose aligns to the mainstream diploma programme.

                        <h3>Rationale for Qualification</h3>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            The design of the qualification caters for the ICT-industry needs for life-long learning, continuing professional development and specialisation at higher levels. The qualification also serves as a platform for entry into postgraduate studies thereby contributing to the national development goals of increasing the number of post graduates in South Africa – increasing access to postgraduate qualifications for previously disadvantaged communities is also an express aim of MUT. This qualification contributes to MUT's vision of becoming a pre-eminent and distinguished university of technology as no other HEI in KwaZulu-Natal currently offers this qualification. It is aligned to MUT's mission of providing advanced technology-based programmes and contributes to creating an equitable and prosperous Southern Africa in which individuals can achieve their full potential by opening access paths to further studies and preparing learners for advanced entry into the ICT industry.
